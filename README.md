# Grocery Macro Tracker

Grocery Macro Tracker is a simple Streamlit app that helps you search foods from USDA FoodData Central and view their nutrition macros (calories, protein, carbs, fat).  
The long-term vision is to build a smarter grocery and nutrition assistant that helps manage both **health goals** and **grocery budgets**.

## Current Features
- Search for multiple foods at once  
- Nutrition lookup powered by USDA FoodData Central API  
- Results displayed in a clean, filterable table  
- Macro totals across all foods entered  

## Planned Features
- Upload grocery receipts for automatic parsing of foods and quantities  
- Handle cases where quantities are missing (default to 100 grams)  
- Bulk buying recommendations for cost savings  
- Recipe ideas based on ingredients on hand  
- Healthy substitute suggestions to satisfy cravings  

## Project Vision
Grocery costs continue to rise, and eating healthy can feel overwhelming without the right tools.  
This project bridges the gap between **budgeting and nutrition** by giving users a clear breakdown of the macros in their groceries.  

- **For budgeting**: Smarter store choices and opportunities for bulk savings.  
- **For health**: Tracking macros at the grocery stage helps stick to dietary goals (cutting, bulking, or balanced living).  
- **For planning**: AI-powered features will suggest recipes, substitutions, and cost-saving shopping strategies.

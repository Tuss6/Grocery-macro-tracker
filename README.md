# Grocery Macro Tracker ü•¶

**Grocery Macro Tracker** is a simple Streamlit app that helps you search foods from USDA FoodData Central and view their nutrition macros (calories, protein, carbs, fat).  
The long-term vision is to build a smarter grocery and nutrition assistant that helps manage both health goals and grocery budgets.
